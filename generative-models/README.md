# Foundation Models for Medical Imaging

Welcome to Episode 07 of BENDER. In this episode, we discuss foundation models and their emerging role in medical imaging.

Foundation models are large-scale models trained on vast amounts of data that can be adapted to various downstream tasks. In medical imaging, these models promise to:
- Enable few-shot learning for rare diseases
- Improve generalization across different imaging modalities
- Accelerate development of AI tools for healthcare

Key topics covered:
- What are foundation models?
- Pre-training strategies for medical imaging
- Fine-tuning and adaptation techniques
- Challenges in medical domains (data privacy, regulatory compliance)
- Current research and future directions

Notable examples in medical imaging include models like:
- MedCLIP for vision-language understanding
- Various self-supervised learning approaches
- Multi-modal foundation models

- Ongoing research in the field

As with any powerful technology, foundation models in healthcare require careful consideration of bias, safety, and ethical implications.
