# The ü§ñ BENDER series:

Are you a new(ish) Graduate or a super-enthusiastic Undergraduate student working with Medical Image data, and pondering over how to get that Deep Learning model to train with it? If so, this repository is for you: 

It supports the [BENDER (BEst practices in medical imagiNg DEep leaRning) series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFwdflE4leRpqIz-F68pvwFATIOEwrSHp), which is submitted to [the MICCAI Education Challenge, 2022](https://miccai-sb.github.io/challenge.html).

We invite you to watch along the following episodes (click on the pictures below to watch on YouTube) that track the life and times of a new student who has just started working with this kind of data: through the ups and downs of the journey to build a State-of-The-Art model. 

We hope through the experience of this student, you learn not to make the same mistakes, and get a head-start in your own exploration.

## Episode 1: ‚ÄúExploratory analysis: The Data Pile‚Äù

See [checklist](/exploratory-data-analysis/checklist.md) for a list of keepawakes while dealing with clinical data. We believe checking off all of these as a bare minimum would help avoid üí£ surprises later on. 

A downloadable PDF version is [here](/exploratory-data-analysis/checklist.pdf).

[Exploring the Dermamnist data set](https://github.com/ubern-mia/bender/blob/main/episode01/explore_dermamnist.ipynb) is a notebook that uses data from  [MedMNIST](https://medmnist.com/) to demonstrate examples of the kinds of details you should look for, while analyzing your clinical data.

If you are lucky (or not üòâ) to be working with DICOM data, [Exploring DICOM tags](https://github.com/ubern-mia/bender/blob/main/episode01/explore_dicom.ipynb) is a notebook to demonstrate how to go about looking at the non-image metadata as well! 

[Here](http://www.r2d3.us/) is a wonderful (non-medical-imaging) example of how simply "looking" at the data prior to modeling helps make sense of the landscape, and is a step that one must not neglect while starting off!

For more specialized data, there are standards like [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io), Brain Imaging Data structure, for organizing multiple subject files for neuroimaging. Consider conforming to such formats to ensure easier read/write/convert workflows with your data set.

In this context, Data-centered AI is gaining more attention, especially through these papers:
- [DataPerf: Benchmarks for Data-Centric AI Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10062)
- [Advances, challenges and opportunities in creating data for trustworthy AI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00516-1)
- [IEEE Spectrum article: Andrew Ng, AI Minimalist: The Machine-Learning Pioneer Says Small is the New Big](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9754503)

## Episode 3: ‚ÄúTraining models: Good model training shall you strive for‚Äù

[Follow along this episode](/training-models/README.md) for the next step of actually building a model.

We start with a naive implementation (as [ipynb](/training-models/dermamnist_v1_initial.ipynb) or a [py script](/training-models/dermamnist_v1_initial.py)), walking through the process of improving it iteratively in seven versions to finally beat the [benchmark listed on the MedMNIST webpage](https://medmnist.com) in an organized experimental fashion!

## Episode 4: ‚ÄúEvaluating your model: Born to Deploy‚Äù

In [this episode](/evaluating-and-deploying-model/README.md), the focus is on evaluation and deployment: specific points that are important to keep in mind for clinical relevance, out-of-distribution data, and other interesting bits.
